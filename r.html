	String theory, often called the “theory of everything,” is a relatively young science that includes such unusual concepts as superstrings, branes, and extra dimensions. Scientists are hopeful that string theory will unlock one of the biggest mysteries of the universe, namely how gravity and quantum physics fit together.String theory is a work in progress, so trying to pin down exactly what the science is, or what its fundamental elements are, can be kind of tricky. The key string theory features include: objects in tempts to reconcile general relativity (gravity) with quantum physics.A new connection (called supersymmetry) exists between two fundamentally different types of particles, bosons and fermions.
